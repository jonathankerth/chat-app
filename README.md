# My React Native Mobile Chat App

Welcome to my mobile chat application built using React Native. This app provides you with a seamless chat experience, allowing you to easily connect with friends and family. You can share messages, images, and even your location, all within the app.

## Overview

As a developer passionate about mobile applications, I understand the importance of creating user-friendly experiences. That's why I chose to build this chat app using React Native. With React Native, I can leverage a single codebase to create Android and iOS apps simultaneously. To enhance the development process, I also utilized Expo and Google Firestore Database to ensure smooth and efficient communication.

## User Stories

- As a new user, I wanted to create a hassle-free onboarding experience. That's why I added a feature that allows you to enter a chat room and start chatting with friends and family right away.
- As a user, I love staying connected with my loved ones. That's why I made sure you can send messages and keep everyone updated with the latest news.
- Sharing special moments with others is important to me. That's why I incorporated the ability to share images, allowing you to showcase what you're doing or where you've been.
- Sometimes, sharing your location can be incredibly useful. Whether it's meeting up with friends or just letting someone know where you are, I made it easy for you to share your location with others.
- I understand the need to revisit conversations, even when offline. To accommodate this, I ensured that you can read your messages offline, giving you the flexibility to reread conversations at any time.
- Accessibility is important to me, so I made sure this chat app is compatible with screen readers, making it accessible for users with visual impairments.

## Features

- Personalization is key. That's why I added a page where you can enter your name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- The app provides a user-friendly interface, displaying the conversation history along with an input field and submit button, making it effortless to send messages.
- To enhance communication, I incorporated two additional features: the ability to send images and share your location with others.
- Your data is securely stored both online and offline, ensuring you never lose your valuable conversations.

## Necessary Libraries Installation

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. In the project directory, install all the necessary libraries using npm. Run the command `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed properly.
2. Once all the libraries are installed, you can start the project by running `npm start`.

## Technical Requirements

Here are some technical details about the app:

- The app is developed using React Native, harnessing its power to create a seamless cross-platform experience.
- Expo is used to simplify the development process, providing a suite of tools and services that streamline app creation.
- To ensure efficient communication, chat conversations are stored in Google Firestore Database, enabling real-time updates and synchronization.

- Sharing images is made easy by allowing users to pick and send images directly from their phone's image library.
- Users can also take pictures using the device's camera app and send them instantly within the chat.
- Images are securely stored in Firebase Cloud Storage, ensuring reliable and scalable storage for your shared images.
- The app can access the user's location data, allowing you to share your current location via a map view within the chat.
